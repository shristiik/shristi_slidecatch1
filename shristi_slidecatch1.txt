Pseudocode
Initialize the Game
Import necessary libraries (pygame, random).
Initialize Pygame.
Set screen dimensions (screen_width, screen_height).
Create the game screen with the specified dimensions.
Set the game window caption to "Space Rescue".
Define colors (white, black).
Load images:
spaceship_img
astronaut_img
debris_img
background_img
Scale the images to appropriate sizes.
Define Classes
Spaceship Class:

Initialize the spaceship:
Set the image to spaceship_img.
Get the rectangle of the image.
Set the initial position to the center bottom of the screen.
Set the movement speed.
Update the spaceship's position based on user input:
If left arrow key is pressed and spaceship is within screen boundaries, move left.
If right arrow key is pressed and spaceship is within screen boundaries, move right.
Astronaut Class:

Initialize the astronaut:
Set the image to astronaut_img.
Get the rectangle of the image.
Reset the astronaut's position and speed.
Reset the astronaut:
Set the y-coordinate to 10 (top of the screen).
Set the x-coordinate to a random value within screen width.
Set the falling speed to a random value between minSpeed and maxSpeed.
Update the astronaut's position:
Move the astronaut down by its speed.
If the astronaut leaves the bottom of the screen, reset its position.
Debris Class:

Initialize the debris:
Set the image to debris_img.
Get the rectangle of the image.
Reset the debris's position and speed.
Reset the debris:
Set the y-coordinate to 10 (top of the screen).
Set the x-coordinate to a random value within screen width.
Set the falling speed to a random value between minSpeed and maxSpeed.
Update the debris's position:
Move the debris down by its speed.
If the debris leaves the bottom of the screen, reset its position.
Create Sprite Groups
Create a group for all sprites.
Create a group for astronauts.
Create a group for debris.
Create Sprite Instances
Create an instance of Spaceship and add it to the all_sprites group.
Create multiple instances of Astronaut and add them to the all_sprites and astronauts groups.
Create multiple instances of Debris and add them to the all_sprites and debris groups.
Main Game Loop
Set running to True.
Create a clock object to manage the frame rate.
While running:
Check for events:
If the event type is QUIT, set running to False.
Update all sprites.
Check for collisions between spaceship and astronauts:
If a collision occurs, reset the collided astronaut.
Check for collisions between spaceship and debris:
If a collision occurs, handle it (e.g., print a message or trigger game over).
Draw everything:
Blit the background image onto the screen.
Draw all sprites onto the screen.
Update the display.
Cap the frame rate to 60 frames per second.
Quit the Game
Quit Pygame.
